# For bug reports or update requests
If you encounter a bug or want to request an update, simply create an issue [here](https://github.com/rune-scape/PyMacroRecord/issues)

# For people who don't have windows or don't want to use exe file
- First, if you didn't already, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Download the last source code release [here](https://github.com/rune-scape/PyMacroRecord/releases)

- Extract it wherever you want.
- Open the terminal and type `cd <PATH TO SOFTWARE FOLDER>`
- Type the command:
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  - If you are on **Linux**, you might need to install Tkinter manually, commands to install are [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-tkinter-on-linux/)
  - You need to remove the **win10toast** from `requirements.txt` if you are not on windows or else you won't be able to install the depedencies
  - Mac Users, you must add terminal to accessibility and input monitoring settings in system preferences to allow mouse and keyboard inputs.
  - (Optional) If you want these package to be on virtual environment follow these step [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41799834)
- Finally, do `cd src` and type: `python3 main.py`
- And boom! The software is now ready to use.

# Build (Windows)
To build the application, I use PyInstaller.

You need to be on home directory, not on src.

Then, use that command for onefile output (upx is optional).
```
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --icon "src/assets/logo.ico" --name "PyMacroRecord-portable" --contents-directory "." --upx-dir upx --add-data "src/assets;assets/" --add-data "src/hotkeys;hotkeys/" --add-data "src/macro;macro/" --add-data "src/utils;utils/" --add-data "src/windows;windows/" --add-data "src/langs;langs"  "src/main.py"
```

For onedir output, use that command (upx is optional).

```
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onedir --windowed --icon "src/assets/logo.ico" --name "PyMacroRecord" --contents-directory "." --upx-dir upx --add-data "src/assets;assets/" --add-data "src/hotkeys;hotkeys/" --add-data "src/macro;macro/" --add-data "src/utils;utils/" --add-data "src/langs;langs" --add-data "src/windows;windows/"  "src/main.py"
```
